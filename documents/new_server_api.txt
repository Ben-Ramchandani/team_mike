#Simplified Server/device API


### For the job server ###
==========================


#Use HTTP(S) over TCP, with UTF-8 encoded JSON in the body.

### Device requesting job ###

HTTP POST to /getjob

#Include JSON body:

{
    "version": "0.0.1",
    "phone-id": "ANDROID_ID",
    #Battery, memory, location...
}

#Expect response
#We inlcude a job and computation ID
#Small amounts of data for the job are included within this request,
#e.g number ranges.
#Pictures and similar should be requested separately from the data server.

HTTP response code 200 - OK, close connection.

#Include JSON body:

{
    "version": "0.0.1",
    "jobData": "string",                #A small amount (<1MB) of data to send from the job server.
    "fetchJobData": bool,               #Should extra data be fetched from /data/$computationName$/$jobName$?
    "fetchComputationData": bool,       #Should extra data be fetched from /data/$computationName$?
    "computationName": "name",          #Name assigned by the server, unique identifier, instead of ID
    "jobName": "name",                  #Name assigned by the server, unique identifier
    "jobDescriptionName": "string",     #name to send to UI for display
    "jobDescription": "string"          #Description to send to the UI to display
}


# If no jobs are available on the server return HTTP response 555 - No Job, close connection

#On other errors use normal HTTP response codes:
#404 - not found, 400 - bad request, 503 - service unavailable e.t.c



### Phone submitting Job ###

HTTP POST to /submitjob

#Include JSON body:

{
    "version": "0.0.1",
    "phone-id": "ANDROID_ID",
    #Battery, memory, location...
    "computationName": "name",      #Name assigned by the server, unique identifier
    "jobName": "name",              #Name assigned by the server, unique identifier
    "resultData": "string"          #Result of the job
}


#Expect empty 200 - OK response



### Phone requesting the server log something ###
#For debugging/error purposes

HTTP POST /log
{
    "version": "0.0.1",
    "phone-id": "ANDROID_ID",
    "logData": "string"
}

#Expect 200 - OK




### For the Data server ###
===========================

#This HTTP(S) server gives out the .class files for the device to run,
#as well as larger blocks of data, like hi-res images, to relieve load on the job server.
#It will have a separate address to the job server (though this may be the same address because we are poor)
#Will run on a different port

#If extra data is required from this the "fetchJobData" or "fetchComputationData" flags will be set in the JSON.
#Computation data and code fetched from here may be cached. 

#For code point URLClassLoader at /code/$computationName/$

#Request data from 
#/data/$computationName$ or /data/$computationName$/$jobName$.

#Normal HTTP(S) GET, no JSON metadata.
