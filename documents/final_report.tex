\section{Summary}

We have built a platform for performing distributed computation on idle mobile devices.

On top of this we have built examples for the purpose of the demo.
Via the web interface users may submit computations in the form of either prime number checking or one of several image manipulation tasks.
These tasks are then split up into jobs which are sent out to run on multiple devices.
Once the results have been collated, or even as they are coming in, they are returned in real time to the website.

The system is split conceptually into three parts: the server that manages the jobs and hosts the website, the service running on the device that does the computation
and the interface for the app that allows the end user to view information about and control the service.
All the parts are built to allow any form of computation, we have built examples intended for the demo.


\subsection{Server}

The server is written almost entirely in Java using the Play! framework and the the Ebeans persistence plug-in.

\subsubsection{Job management}
%this is a bit brief and not that well written
The server accepts new computations, splits them up into jobs each with their own bit of data, it manages handing out the jobs to the devices along with
the data and code needed to complete them, it receives the results of completed jobs, handles jobs and hence computations failing, as well
as data being returned when jobs or computations complete.
Information about jobs and computations is stored in the database and can be recovered
in case of a crash or restart.
Information about devices using the system is also kept persistently, including the number of jobs they have completed and failed.

\subsubsection{Website}


The website is designed to demo the system, though it could be expanded to allow for paying customers if Twork were to be made into a full product.
The website allows computations to be introduced into the system and results are returned in real time using WebSockets. It allows uploading a number of files and applying a function on them, being in tune with the server. New features can be added easily as soon as they become available. Some ideas for this are relevant statistics on computation completion, new types of functions supported etc.


\subsection{Twork app}

\section{Successes}

%It worksish
%It is very modular so we can easily extend it: we have the map file computation which can basically do anything given we have %the function, which is pretty cool

\section{Difficulties}

%Eg. class loading in Android
% problems with Play! docs
% problems with deploying on amazon web services
% security issues

\section{Acceptance criteria}

%Did we follow the spec?

\section{Summary of the work undertaken}

%razvan

Razvan began by researching the various options for building the server, and he suggested that we should use the Play! Framework, as well as various other dependencies, such as the Ebean persistancy. Razvan then created the main data types for the original prototype, as well as the controllers for HTTP requests. 
Razvan then created a front end for our server, where people can add their own computations (currently supporting only simple image processing), as well as testing our framework with a simple  prime number checker. Results come back in real time.
